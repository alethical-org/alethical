# Page-load performance decisions

**Net:** Improve the shared first download and the saved Ask path without changing what readers see or how current the record is. Keep every option that delays another click, risks stale data, or depends on experimental routing out of the automatic safe-work lane.

## Priority order

Reliability comes first: every public page and deep link must load on its first attempt without a refresh. After that, reduce the work before useful content appears.

The Aug 7, 2026 production audit found:

- The shared website program was about 1.97 MB before compression and about 510 KB over its live Brotli path.
- A high-quality local Brotli build of the same program was about 401 KB.
- The saved SF 334 answer became readable in about 610 ms with the website program already saved by the browser.
- The saved-answer server request took 363 to 438 ms, then the page requested bill detail, votes, and structured text.
- A cold phone legislator profile requested 100 chief-authored bills, about 47 KB, and the request took about 1.56 seconds.
- Cached public reads commonly took 60 to 90 ms; uncached reads commonly took 500 to 1,600 ms.

Each release issue records a fresh before-and-after measurement because the shared file changes whenever `main` changes.

## Safe work with no intended reader tradeoff

| Order | Work | Why it is safe | Tracker |
|---:|---|---|---|
| 1 | Read an existing public suggested answer through a cacheable, self-contained address | A miss never generates, reader-written questions never enter the path, and citations stay unchanged | [#1230](https://github.com/alethical-org/alethical/issues/1230) |
| 2 | Send a smaller shared program and discover the existing fonts earlier | The design and behavior stay fixed; browser and route checks must prove file delivery before release | [#1231](https://github.com/alethical-org/alethical/issues/1231) |
| 3 | Keep phone-only sign-in code out of the website build | Sign-in timing and behavior stay fixed; the web build only stops carrying unused phone tools | [#1232](https://github.com/alethical-org/alethical/issues/1232) |

## Remaining options with a real tradeoff or open proof gap

| Option | Benefit | Tradeoff or proof gap | Decision |
|---|---|---|---|
| Send useful page content in the first HTML response | Removes the empty-page wait on cold primary pages and deep links | The current navigation cannot do this directly; the supported options require a navigation rebuild or a separate public rendering path | Run the measured prototype in [#502](https://github.com/alethical-org/alethical/issues/502) before choosing an architecture |
| Load 2 chief-authored bills first on phone profiles | Avoids the measured 47 KB, 1.56-second cold request | “Show all” would start a later request and make that click wait | Do not ship as no-tradeoff work |
| Keep public data in nearby caches longer | More cold reads move from 500 to 1,600 ms toward 60 to 90 ms | Current bill, vote, and roster changes appear later | Keep the current freshness policy until the product chooses a longer delay |
| Replace Space Grotesk or JetBrains Mono | Could remove about 13 to 44 KB of font downloads on pages using them | Changes the logo or code-like visual style | Do not treat as performance-only work |
| Split every route into a later program download | Makes the first route's program smaller | The first visit to every other route waits for another download, and the Expo path is experimental | Keep closed [#491](https://github.com/alethical-org/alethical/issues/491) closed unless the platform becomes stable and measurements favor it |
| Remove screens that web links currently redirect away from | Removes about 5 KB from the website program | Some screens still support phone or signed-in flows, including the working chat room that currently lacks a public door | Do not call this dead code without a capability decision |
| Skip rendering off-screen bill text | Can help unusually large bills | Can break section jumps, browser search, and accessibility; the measured sample was only 477 elements | Reconsider only after a real large-bill trace shows rendering is the bottleneck |

## Release proof

A safe page-load release is done only when:

- every required public page type loads directly on phone and desktop with 0 browser errors;
- old shared links still work;
- sign-in, session restore, citations, and current record fields are unchanged;
- the current production file or request count is smaller by direct measurement; and
- the live release passes after the merge, not only in a local build.
